Provides a mechanism in which the user can cycle through locally-installed Vim ColorSchemes, by using keystrokes.

Current features:
- Easily cycle back-and-forth between locally-available Vim colorschemes using keystrokes.
- Default keystrokes are \<C-n\> and \<C-p\> but can be customised.

Future features that will be added soon:
- Automatically save the loaded colorscheme as your default in .vimrc.
- Override Vim colorschemes for recognised Vim filetypes in .vimrc.

This plugin was tested to work with Vim versions 8.0 to newer, as well as NeoVim.
